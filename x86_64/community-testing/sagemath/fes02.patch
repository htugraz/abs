-Binding for the FES library.
+Binding for the libFES library.
 
 Finding solutions of systems of boolean equations by exhaustive
 search, via the fes library. This is usually (much) faster than
 computing a Groebner basis, except in special cases where the latter
 is particularly easy.

+
+The libFES library is presently only able to deal with polynomials in 64
 variables. Performing a full exhaustive search over 64 variables will
 take a **long** time. The number of variables can be artificially
 reduced to 64 by specializing some of them.
 
-Note that the FES library **requires** at least of the equations to be
