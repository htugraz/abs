Subject: [PATCH] i8254: fix out-of-bounds memory access in pit_ioport_read()

Due converting PIO to the new memory read/write api we no longer provide
separate I/O region lenghts for read and write operations. As a result,
reading from PIT Mode/Command register will end with accessing
pit->channels with invalid index.

Fix this by ignoring read from the Mode/Command register.

This is CVE-2015-3214.
