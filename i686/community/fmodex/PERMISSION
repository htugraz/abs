Subject: Redistribution for Arch Linux

 Hello,

 I'm a packager for the Arch Linux project (http://www.archlinux.org) and
 I would like to ask you for permission for redistributing FMOD in binary
 form in our project. Arch Linux is a free operating system and is run
 entirely by volunteers. There is no commercial context.

 Regards,
 Sven-Hendrik Haase
